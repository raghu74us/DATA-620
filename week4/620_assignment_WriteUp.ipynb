    "This is who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a platform called Bitcoin Alpha. \n",

Members of Bitcoin Alpha rate other members in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. This is the first explicit weighted signed directed network available for research.\n",
